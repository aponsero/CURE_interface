			<p>
				Welcome to the Data Hero portal ! 
				This website allows you to explore and query datasets that interrogate the current reproducibility practices in bioinformatics.

				The first project of the Data Hero class is called 'Database Justice League' and is an up-to-date ressource exploring the accessibility of biological databases. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				Please note that the data for the "Database Justice League" leverage and expand on the dataset gathered and published in <a href=" http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-008"> Imker, H.J., 2020. Who Bears the Burden of Long-Lived Molecular Biology Databases?. Data Science Journal, 19(1), p.8</a>.</br></br>

		<p> Undergraduate research experiences, during which students perform research under the direct supervision of an experienced mentor have long been part of the training of the next generation of scientists. These internships promote the development of general thinking and learning skills, as well as fostering collaborative and communication skills. However, these research opportunities are constrained by laboratory capacity, and can only accommodate for a relatively small number of students, and can be challenging to obtain for students who, due to financial or familial reasons, cannot afford to invest additional time outside classes. Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) have been developed to address this specific need and to engage a larger number of undergraduate students into research experiences. During these classes, a team of students develop, conduct and communicate a real-world research project. While hands-on workshops and active learning material can help engage students and favorize the long-term acquisition of practical skills, a research experience grounded in real scientific work allows the students to engage with their research topic on a deeper cognitive and emotional level. Additionally, research experiences in CUREs foster great conditions to develop both mentorship relations with teachers and help collaborations grow between students.<br><br>
		
		Despite a growing demand for data scientists, university training in science ethics, code licensing and best reproducibility practices are not generalized for undergraduates. Our team, selected in the 2020 cohort at the CURE training institute, has been developing a CURE where students will develop and conduct an assessment of the current landscape and the evolution of accessibility, documentation and reproducibility practices in bioinformatics. The "data heroes" CURE is be a three-credit course in the Department of Biosystems Engineering accessible to students from any college, and is taught remotely starting in Fall 2020.<br><br>
		
		In our CURE, students learn and reflect upon best practices for reproducibility in bioinformatics. Several practical skills will also be developed such as defining and conducting a research plan, as well as the use of computational tools for code versioning and documentation.
